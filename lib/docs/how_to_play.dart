## Rules of the game

It's the <img src="assets/jotaro_kujo.png" width=30> team versus the <img src="assets/dio_brando.png" width=30>
team.

The first team make the HP of opponent to 0 will be win.

Before you action, you must to roll 2 dices, the dices have 6 side: 1 -> 6.

The Dices will randomly roll and return you the result.

Base on the result of roll, you need to choice Attack or Heal.

## How to play

Playing Community Battle game on my GitHub profile is easy. The dice have already been rolled
for you &mdash; all you have to do is decide what to do with them. Anyone
with a GitHub account can play.

Anyone can join either team at any time, but once you're in a team, you're
locked into it until the game ends. You won't be able to play a move when
it's the other team's turn.

The list of links below the board image shows each possible move. Clicking
one of those will take you to a page where you can create an issue in this
repository, where all you have to do is click submit to play your move.

It will take a moment for Github Actions to acknowledge your move, it'll also make a commit to record your move.
